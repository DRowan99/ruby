# Project Euler

Presented here are my solutions to problems posed by [Project Euler][project_euler].

Though the solutions to each problem can be generated by running the scripts hosted here, 
I will not post any of the specific numeric solutions. Additionally, I do not recommend that anyone
who seriously wants to learn any maths by working on problems from Project Euler read any of
the methods used toward solutions here until having solved the problems themselves. You will learn
and grow much more by thinking long and hard and trying/refining different methods than you would from
simply reading through someone else's work. After all, no one likes speulers. (Zing!)

_Disclaimer:_ All solutions presented here are my own unless otherwise noted. ![Scout's Honor!][scouts_honor]
