- I had a ((an adjective)) sandwich for lunch today.  It dripped all over my ((a body part)) and ((a noun)).

- Our favorite language is ((a gemstone)).

- Our favorite language is ((gem:a gemstone)).  We think ((gem)) is better than ((a gemstone)).

- Our favorite language is ((fave gem:a gemstone)).  We think ((fave gem)) is better than ((other gem:a gemstone)). ((other gem)) is more useful for certain things like ((a verb ending in 'ing')) ((an animal - plural)) but ((fave gem)) is more all-purpose - it even works on ((a global problem)).

- Today my ((a family member)) made me eat my ((an adjective)) ((a piece of clothing)).

- I don't like ((idiot:a politician)). ((idiot)) is a ((adj:an adjective)) ((animal:an animal)) and should be ((punished:a punishment - past tense)). Please donate to my charity to have all ((adj)) ((animal))s be ((punished)) today and make a safer ((a place)) for tomorrow.
