# Ruby in the Rough

Here you will find a collection of problems that I have worked on from various outlets to keep my ruby skills sharp and have fun exploring problems for problems sake.

Currently I'm working through questions from [Ruby Quiz][ruby_quiz] (ruby! yay!) and [Project Euler][proj_euler] (math! Euler! yay!), with plans to play a few holes of ruby golf now and again.

I'm always interested in hearing constructive feedback or having a dialogue if you find yourself reading through some of this stuff and have any comments, questions, or jokes at my expense. Thanks for stopping by.
